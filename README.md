# VoicemeeterLogoCover
A simple AutoHotKey script with a gui element to cover the logo of voicemeeter banana, which opens the website and steals focus. Constantly accidentally clicked because the window has no conventional title bar to move it.

# Required

  - [Voicemeeter Banana](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) 
  - [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/)

**If any of the obove are missing, this will not function**


# Use
Make sure you have installed VoiceMeeter Banana and AutoHotKey properly. Place **_vmLogo.png_** inside VoiceMeeter's install directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\VB\Voicemeeter).
With Voicemeeter Banana running, run **VoicemeeterLogoCover.ahk**
The new logo cover should appear like in the above image. Now when you're trying to move the window and click the logo, a browser window wont open.
For best results, add the script to your startup folder.
